It is a gorgeous building that, every three years, plays host to the Verse [pause for effect]- a collective of odd individuals with grand personalities and strange mannerisms. 
You play as Josh, an estranged father whose daughter has been taken by the Verse, and must infiltrate the organisation to save her. 
Making this more complicated is the fact that the Verse is a verifiable cult with odd etiquettes to follow and secrets that are so juicy they wouldnâ€™t feel out of place in a hot-topic Netflix drama."""
